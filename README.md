# FEM
Mathematics course in FEM and parrallel computing
2D curvilinear mesh used to solve the MHD equations with the Finite Volume Method. Note mesh must be structured because a 5 point stencil will be used to get 2nd order reconstruction. The code will be able to read in a mesh from Gmsh and run to a various end time the instability to analyze will be the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. HLL flux will be utilized first with the hope to implement Powell if time permits
